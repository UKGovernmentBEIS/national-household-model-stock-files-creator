#'##Make additional-properties data
#'Create a .csv file using the function make.additionalproperties, which creates a 
#'dataframe containing a complete set of populated variables for the additional-prope
#'rties.csv stock file.
#'
#'This file must be present in the stock import DTO package but can be empty save for
#'the aacode field containing the survey code. However, additional field can be added
#'to the file that can be called from scenarios in the NHM.
#'
#'Here a selection of variables of interest are selected in to a data.frame that is 
#'saved as a csv file as part of the make.england function. 
#'
#' @param allEntries - the merged collection of all SPSS files used in the stock 
#' conversion process.
