# Accessing Housing Stock Data
The NHM stock conversion programmes use housing condition surveys from England, Wales and Scotland. The most recently available versions of the surveys are:

* English Housing Survey 2012 (EHS 2012)
* Living in Wales Survey 2008 (LiW 2008)
* Scottish Housing Condition Survey 2007-09 (SHCS 2011-13)

In order to access the England and Wales housing stock data, you will need to register for an account with the UK Data Archive and access the housing stock databases through the UK Data Service website. 
Registering for access through the UK data archive can be done here:

## England Housing Survey
There are three separate data sets associated with the English Housing Survey: the physical survey, the household survey and the derived fuel poverty datasets. These can be found on the following web pages on the UK Data Service website: 

* [English Housing Survey, 2012: Housing Stock Data (SN 7511)](http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue?sn=7511)
* [English Housing Survey: Fuel Poverty Dataset, 2012 (SN 7539)](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=7539)

## Living in Wales Survey
The housing survey conducted in Wales is also split into a household survey and a physical survey and can be found on the UK Data Archive:

* [2008 Living in Wales: Property Survey page](http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=7202&type=Data%20catalogue)
* [2008 Living in Wales: Household Survey page](http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=6351&type=Data%20catalogue)

This is currently the most up to date housing survey for Wales. However, future surveys are being planned.

## Scottish House Condition Survey
The Scottish House Condition Survey is available on the [Scottish Government website]( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/SHCS/DataAccess). However, this does not necessarily contain all the required variables to create a housing stock for the NHM and additional variables will need to be requested from the SHCS team. Details of how to request a Special Dataset can be found [here]( http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/16002/SpecialDatasets).
