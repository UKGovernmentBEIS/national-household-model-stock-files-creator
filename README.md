# Synopsis
A series of R scripts that can be used to create structured zip file known as the 'Default Import Package' that can be imported by the [National Household Model](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/national-household-model-standalone) as a housing stock. For more information on the content and structure of files within the 'Default Import Package' please see the Stock section within the [NHM documentation](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/national-household-model-documentation/releases).

The source files from which the stock files are created cannot be distributed via this public repository, however details for how these files can be obtained can be found [here](accessing_housing_stock_data.md). Once downloaded they files should be added to their respective directories in the '/data folder' as follows:

1. Copy the contents of SN 7511 into folder data/EHS_2012
2. Create a folder called 'fuel_poverty' within data/EHS_2012 and  Copy the contents of SN 7539 into it
3. Copy the contents of both the Living in Wales:Property Survey and Living in Wales:Household Survey into data/LiW-2008
4. Copy the Scottish survey data file into data/SHCS_11-13, ensure the file is re-named external_cse_data.sav
